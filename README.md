# Browser-Harp

A simple Tone.js & CSS device, playing back harp samples using the mouse to virtually pluck the strings and keyboard to change chords.

Use your mouse to hover over the bars and they play the notes in a chord, change the chord with the S - K keys. It's very simple, honest. You'll figure it out.

Working on developing the UI in canvas so it works on mobile.
